# LaminarOS
WARG's Custom OS Layer between ZP and Bare Metal

To build: In the LaminarOS directory run `./Tools/build.bash -p nucleof401re`. This will build for the nucleof401re boardfiles and will do a fresh build everytime. The build script is still being worked on so this is the most stable command to run.
